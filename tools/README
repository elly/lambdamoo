My grand plan here is to write tools that make it easier for lambdamoo
administrators to manage large databases. To that end, I'm writing:

lmc:   LambdaMOO compiler. Will compile an as-yet unspecified source language into
       a LambdaMOO database.
lmld:  LambdaMOO linker. Will support merging LambdaMOO databases, to allow
       incremental compilation and live updates.
lmdis: LambdaMOO disassembler. Will dump databases, either in human-readable
       form or in source form, suitable for feeding to lmc.
